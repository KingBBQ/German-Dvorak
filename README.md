# German - Dvorak

'German - Dvorak' is a German Dvorak keyboard layout for Mac OS X.

It was changed to a "different" set of keys to my personal flavor :-) 

See [wiki](http://github.com/sos4nt/German-Dvorak/wiki) for details.

## Install

Copy both, the `.keylayout` and the `.icns` file, to either
`/Library/Keyboard Layouts` (system wide) or `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts` (your account only).

    git clone http://github.com/sos4nt/German-Dvorak.git
    
    cp German-Dvorak/German-Dvorak.* /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/

Open *Apple menu* > *System Preferences* > *Language & Text* (*International* in 10.5) > *Input Sources*
and select 'Deutsch - Dvorak'.

## About

The keylayout file is based on the German system layout that comes with [Ukulele](http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele).
